### Project overview
This data analysis project aims to provide insight on the employees in the organization over a period of twenty years. By analyzing various aspect of employee data.
I seek to identify trends, With data driven reccomendation, i gained deeper understanding of the employee analysis.
### Data source
Employee data; The primary data used for this analysis is the employee(people)data.csv containing detailed information about each employee of the organization.

### Tools
Power BI - With the help of power BI, i was able to Extract, transform(ETL) and load the data 
### Data extraction/preparation
This is the first step that must be taken, i extracted the employee data from it's source
### Data transformation/Cleaning
After extracting the data, the next thing i did was to transform or clean the data, i had to remove duplicate where there are not needed. 
create a fact and dimensional table whereby i merged them together giving me the chance to create a beautifull model.
### Load data
After thoroughly cleaning/transforming my data, the next thing i did was to load it making sure it is ready for visualization.
### Data visualization
After succesfully loading my data, I was able to get the total number of employee with the use of DAX formula,I was able get the total number of employee that are active and have been terminated.
as well as the number of employee that worked in HQ and remote workers. I was also able to figure out the total number of employees that had worked with the company for the past twenty years
with the use of DAX formula. I then created my chart which provided insight to my data.

### Result/findings
The analysis results are summarized as follow
1. The department with the highest employee is the engineering department with auditing been the least
2. The number of people that have been employed from the year 2001 to 2020 has been steady with a slight diffrience in number.
3. The total number of employee that are active are relatively much as compared to the terminated employees.

### Reccomendations
Based on the analysis results, the following was reccomended
1. More employment opportunity should be created for females in the organization as the diffrience in male to female emloyee is too much
2. More workers should be employed in the auditing department
3. more employment opportunity should be created for remote workers
